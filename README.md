# Jusion Chain Proof-of-Concept

## TODO

- [ ] Switch to using nix flakes.  There is a simple `flake.nix`, but I am not using it yet.
  - [ ] direnv integration.  Need to install and set up direnv.
- [ ] Basic ZK DSL
- [ ] Basic interface for an L1 Oracle
- [ ] What is sufficient to uniquely determine a transaction?  Block Height and Transaction Position?  Or Transaction Hash?  Or the triple?
